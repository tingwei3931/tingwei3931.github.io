I am Abhishek Sharma, a junior undergraduate pursuing Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in Mathematics and Computing at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi. 

I am interested in building intelligent machines capable of understanding and generating human language. My prior research experience has been in Natural Language Processing specifically using Deep Learning. As intelligence entails sequential decision making, I am also interested in Reinforcement Learning and its possible uses in Natural Language Processing.
