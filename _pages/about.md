Hi! My name is Ting Wei and I am a fresh graduate from UOW KDU University Penang with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. My interest is in programming and building applications to solve problems. In particular, I have keen interest in deep learning especially reinforcement learning and its application in natural language processing (NLP). 

Having a thirst for knowledge, I picked up reading as by pastime hobby to satiate my hunger of learning beyond my horizon. My favorite books are 12 Rules for Life by Prof. Jordan Peterson and Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari.
