Hi! My name is Lim Ting Wei and I am an experienced software engineer working in Intel Corporation. My interest is in programming and building applications to sovle problems. In particular, I have keen interest in back-end programming and automation with Python. I am also fluent in Javascript, C#, Java and many other languages. In my free time, I like to explore large language models (LLMs) and their applications.

Having a thirst for knowledge, I picked up reading as my pasttime hobby to satiate my hunger of learning beyond my horizon. My favourite genre include self-help books, classic literature and philosophy. My favourite books are Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostovesky.
