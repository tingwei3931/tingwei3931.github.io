EssayScore is a web application that is designed to alleviate the burden of teachers in marking essays and to provide a platform for students to gain instant feedback for their essays."Implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend for the model training and Flask microframework for the web application. <br/> From this project, I gained my first introduction into the world of deep learning and learnt how to write, train and deploy deep learning models using various tools such as Keras and TensorFlow. I also had my first experience in using long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal dependencies in essay datasets. Code is on my GitHub repo.
