This was my first machine learning project that I spent some time working on. The project was to build a system which could automatically grade essays. We used LSTM based neural network architectures for the problem. By working on the task, I got familiarised with the machine learning workflow, i.e. analysing data, designing neural network architectures, tuning hyperparameters, error analysis, etc. I also learnt valuable research skills like reading research papers.
