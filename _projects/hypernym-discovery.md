The task was to extract hypernymy pairs from a given corpus. We formulated this task as a classification task where each pair of nouns in a sentence were represented by lexico-syntactic pattern between them (in the form of Dependency trees) or specifically trained word embeddings. We also explored techniques from Information Retrieval which used repeated bootstrapping on the prior knowledge base to find new hypernymy pairs.
